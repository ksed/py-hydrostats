A Python-driven statistical toolbox for the various methods described in ["Statistical Methods in Water Resources" (SMIWR) by Helsel, Hirsch, 2002](http://pubs.usgs.gov/twri/twri4a3/).  It is currently designed to be run once to select a file, and display some initial input file manipulations and statistics before opening the function-selection dialogue for further analysis.

Running the script once loads all of the listed functions/methods into memory for analysis. Thus, if you are running the script within a persistent Python run-time environment (e.g. an IDE, which would allows you log all your latest work-session), you can continue calling any of the functions in the script even after closing the function-selecion dialogue.
